            <p>I went to the North University where Im currently studying Business Management with an emphasis in Networking (yes, I'm a big fan of the internet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I didn't graduate and probably never will since I already learned the topics that would make a difference in my career (OOP, FP, data structures, and compilers). Also, today companies don't require you to have a degree, so it isn't worth investing time.</p>
            <p>After deciding to focus on learning everything related to front-end development (I used this roadmap to track the topics I needed to learn), I spent almost 3 months learning everything from HTML up to ReactJS. Finally, I got my first job in May 2020 at Fluid Attacks.</p>
            <p>Like everyone, I had difficulties in my learning process:</p>
            <ul className='space-y-3'>
              <li className='flex items-center space-x-5'>
                <img className='h-2' src="./images/circle.png" alt="" /> <p>Something didn't click immediately.</p>
              </li>
              <li className='flex items-center space-x-5'>
                <img className='h-2' src="./images/circle.png" alt="" /> <p>I forgot about something I supposedly learned a week before. üòï</p>
              </li>
              <li className='flex items-center space-x-5'>
                <img className='h-2' src="./images/circle.png" alt="" /> <p>Sometimes it was just that the topic was too difficult to wrap my head around it.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>My advice if you're having the same difficulties is to take this course. It'll give you powerful tools to improve your learning ability, and the best thing, is freemium! ü•≥.</p>

            <p>I now work as a Frontend Tech Lead for the Ottomoto account at Lean Tech. I've been developing websites from e-commerce sites to web applications for more than 1 year.</p>
            <p>I continue spending a lot of time learning new technologies, patterns, libraries, etc. And I'm trying different ways to find a balance within that, my current hobbies (CrossFit, videogames, and movies) and the ones I'm trying to build (traveling, cooking and writing).</p>
            <p>I'm going to start creating content about frontend development, so I invite you to maintain contact through my social networks:</p>
